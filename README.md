# Anger Type Personality Test 
This Anger Type Personality test is a Python terminal, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. 
It is a questionary which will track the user input to find out how the relate to anger within themselves. 

[Here is the link to the deployed project]("")


## How it works

The questionary is a list of day to day examples of situations that might trigger ones anger or frustration. The user is asked to answer to think about what they would do in these situations. All the questions are scale questions, meaning the user needs to put in a number on the scale of 10 depended on their reaction to the sketched situation. The program will keep track of their score and will reveal their behavioral pattern at the end of the questionary.
